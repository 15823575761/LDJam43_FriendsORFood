# Friends OR Food

## Intro
This is a repository for the game [Friends OR Food](https://najmm.itch.io/friends-or-food) which I made during the 
[Ludum Dare 43 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com) on the theme of "Sacrifices must be made".
The game has been made using the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/).

- [Play the game on itch.io](https://najmm.itch.io/friends-or-food)
- [Visit the game's Ludum Dare page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/friends-or-food)

## Keypoints
- This game was made using Unity 2018.3
- Most of the inbuilt Unity packages have been disabled via the __Package Manager__
- The __Layer Collision Matrix__ for __Physics2D__ has been modified to work properly with the code
- The [GameManager.cs](https://github.com/najmm01/LDJam43_FriendsORFood/blob/master/Assets/_Project/Scripts/Mono/GameManager.cs) file is set to execute before the other scripts via the __Script Execution Order__ window
